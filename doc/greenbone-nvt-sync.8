.SH SYNOPSIS
.B greenbone-nvt-sync 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B OpenVAS Scanner
performs several security checks. These are called Network Vulnerability Tests
(NVTs) and are implemented in the programming language NASL. Some NVTs are
wrappers for external tools.
As new vulnerabilities are published every day, new NVTs appear in the
Greenbone Security Feed. This feed is commercial and requires a respective subscription key.
In case no subscription key is present, the update synchronisation will use the Community Feed instead.

.br
The script 
.B greenbone-nvt-sync
will fetch all new and updated security checks and install them at the proper
location. Once this is done OpenVAS Scanner, openvassd(8) will automatically detect
that new and updated NVTs are present and consider them for next activities.

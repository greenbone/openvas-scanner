DESCRIPTION OF THE NSR FILE FORMAT
$Id$

The .nsr file format was designed to facilitate the export of openvassd reports
to other tools.

The format is the following for each line :

'hostname|port'				(1)
or
'hostname|port|script_id|type|data'	(2)

The format (1) indicates that a port is open. The format (2) adds
a security report to the information


hostname : the host name or IP address
port     : the port affected. The format is : 'portname (num/protocol)',
	   ie : www (80/tcp). It can also be 'general/protocol', which
	   means that the protocol itself is affected


script_id : is the number of the script which generated the information.
	    see http://cvs.nessus.org/plugins/search.html to find the 
	    name of a plugin thanks to its id

type 	  : either INFO (security warning) or REPORT (security hole)

data   	  : content of the report or warning. All the '\n' chars are
	    replaced by ';'

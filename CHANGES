Main changes compared to 3.4+beta1:
* Changed behaviour of NVT sync script "openvas-nvt-sync":
  It will now delete scripts not part of the when using rsync,
  except for the directory "private/".
  A Migration option "--migrate-to-private" of the sync-script will
  move private scripts into the "private/" directory.
  The Feed Sync will stop with an error until the "private/" is created.

  to the client initially.
* New: command line switch "--only-cache" to just build the cache and exit.
* Changed: The magic that NVTs of category ACT_SETTINGS were always enabled
  even when user disabled them has been removed. OTP clients now have
  to take care to enable as needed.
* Internal code cleanups for NVTI cache handling.
* Fixed a bug when NVT lacks family specification.
* Removed deprecated code.
* Closed a number of memory leaks.

"OpenVAS 5".

This release tightens security when using the external tool "ovaldi", enforces
the internal use of the UTC timezone and features an updated greenbone-nvt-sync
script.

NOTE: Due to the changes in 5.0+beta2, it is strongly recommended to delete the
contents of the OpenVAS Scanner cache directory to remove obsolete files and to
force the Scanner to rebuild the cache.

ATTENTION: The OpenVAS Scanner now enforces the internal use of the UTC
timezone. If the Scanner has been in use with an OpenVAS Manager, it is strongly
recommended to update to OpenVAS Manager >= 5.0+beta5 and to migrate the Manager
database before using this Scanner version to ensure data consistency.

This is the second maintenance release of the openvas-scanner 3.2 module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System release 4 (OpenVAS-4).

It features improvements to the synchronization scripts and a minor code
cleanup. All synchronization scripts are now free of bashisms, meaning they no
longer depend on the GNU Bourne-Again shell to run and should be compatible with
most shells.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Michael Wiegand.

Main changes compared to 3.2.1:
* The last bashism has been removed from the openvas-nvt-sync synchronization
  script.

This is the first release of the openvas-scanner 3.2 module for the Open
Vulnerability Assessment System release 4 (OpenVAS-4). Compared
to the previous major release it contains a major cleanup of code, build process
and installation. This increases the efficiency of the OpenVAS Scanner, makes
the build easier and the installation compliant with the Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard (FHS 2.3).

Featurewise this release adds support for a network scan level, finally gets rid
of binary plugins (existing binary plugins were turned into NASL built-ins and
moved to openvas-libraries 4.0) and improves the handling of setting files. It
exposes the vhosts feature, changes the default port to 9391 and now listens on
IPv4 sockets by default.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to the 4.0.0 release:
Matthew Mundell, Michael Wiegand and Jan-Oliver Wagner.

Main changes compared to 3.1.x:

* Improved output of --version to comply with the GNU Coding Standard.
* Comprehensive code cleanup.
* Binary (.nes) plugins were moved to libraries and turned into built-in
  NASL methods.
* Handling of binary plugins has been removed.
* Added preferences for the vhost feature so that clients get them
  and can offer them to the user. In other words: unhide the vhost feature.
* Default port is now 9391 where the OpenVAS Manager expects the
  Scanner by default.
* Command line options "--dump-cfg" and "--gen-config" are removed.
* openvassd does not need anymore a "openvassd.conf" file. It uses
  its defaults and a possibly present conf-file can overwrite settings.
* openvas-mkcert got a additional switch "-f" to force overwriting
  certificates.
* openvas-mkcert does not create a openvassd.conf anymore as it shares
  the defaults with openvassd.
* Hardening flags are now enabled during compile time to increase code quality.
* openvas-scanner now listens on an IPv4 socket by default, even when IPv6
  support is present.
* The former autotools build environment has been replaces with a build process
  using cmake and using pkgconfig for dependency checks.
* Removed unnecessary log entries.
* Man pages have been updated.

Main changes compared to 3.2+rc2:

* The sync scripts have been updated.
* OpenVAS Scanner now uses pkg-config to find libraries.
* Installation of the openvas-services file has been moved to openvas-libraries.
* Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS 2.3) compliance has been improved.

It features a complete exchange of the build process which now
is cmake-based. Also, numerous code elements were removed
of which it was unclear whether they have still practical relevance.
The third major change concerns the resolving of binary NVTs.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release:
Matthew Mundell, Michael Wiegand and Jan-Oliver Wagner.

Main changes compared to 3.2+rc1:
* Improved output of --version
* Comprehensive code cleanup
* Binary (.nes) plugins we moved to libraries and turned into builtin
  NASL methods.
* Removed handling of binary plugins as we don't want to have them ever
  again.
* Added preferences for the vhost feature so that clients get them
  and can offer them to the user. In other words: unhide the vhost feature.
* Default port is now 9391 where the OpenVAS Manager expects the
  Scanner by default.

  certificates.
* openvas-mkcert does not create a openvassd.conf anymore as it shares
  the defaults with openvassd.

openvas-server 2.0.2 (2009-06-03)

This is the second maintenance release of the openvas-server module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0-series.

It fixes some issues discovered after the release of openvas-server
2.0.1 and introduces support for new features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed.

Effects when installing this version:

* The option "Silent dependencies" is now "off" by default. Previously it was
  set to "on", openvas-client >= 2.0.2 has already switched to "off" per
  default. Note that this may result in larger reports.

* Dependencies: openvas-server 2.0.2 requires openvas-libraries 2.0.2 and
  openvas-libnasl 2.0.1. You need to install these prior to openvas-server 2.0.2.

* The openvas-adduser script will no longer allow passwords in plaintext for new
  users. This means that the openvas-adduser script will refuse to add a new
  user if neither openssl nor md5sums is available.

Main changes since 2.0.1:

* OVAL support has been improved and now supports multiple definitions and
  results in one file.
* Support for per-host password based local checks has been added.
* Debian packaging files have been updated.
* Dependency searching has been improved to work better with subdirectories.
* openvas-server will now generate a warning if a NVT could not be cached.
* The openvas-adduser script will no longer create the now obsolete "plugins"
  directory in the user directory.


Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Vlatko Kosturjak,
Jan Wagner, Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.


openvas-server 2.0.1 (2009-02-17)

This is the first maintenance release of the openvas-server module for the
Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) 2.0-series.

It fixes some issues discovered after the release of openvas-server
2.0.0 and introduces support for new features. Thanks to the continuing
audit of the code, a number of obsolete, unused and/or unnecessary functions
were identified and removed.

Effects when installing this version:

* Dependencies: openvas-server 2.0.1 requires openvas-libraries 2.0.1 and
openvas-libnasl 2.0.1. You need to install these prior to openvas-server 2.0.1.

* Cache files: Effects of openvas-libraries 2.0.1 are changes in the
cache file management. With 2.0.1 release of openvas-server it is
possible to specify a new location for the cache folder. If you will
use a new location, then the effects described for openvas-libraries
do not apply anymore (see also below regarding cache folder).

* New default port of the server: Please be aware that openvas-server
now listens on port 9390 by default since this port has recently been allocated
by IANA for the Openvas Transport Protocol (OTP). If you want to continue to
use the old port 1241, you have to specify the port you want openvasd to
listen on, for example by starting the server with "openvasd -p 1241".
If you don't specify this, it might happen that at next boot of your
system (or other restart of openvasd), the service is available
at a new port and you need to update the connection information
in your OpenVAS-Client.

Main changes since 2.0.0:

* Support for sub-directories in plugins_folder in accordance with
  Change Request #24 (http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-24.html).
* Established automated source code documentation. HTML-Version is available
  under http://www.openvas.org/src-doc/openvas-server/current/index.html
* Openvas-server now uses the IANA-assigned port 9390 for communication
  with the client.
* It is now possible to start openvas-server without root privileges. Note that
  a number of NVTs which rely on operations requiring root privileges (like
  packet forgery) will not work under these circumstances.
* The openvasd-config script now returns the values for sysconfdir, libdir and
  sbindir set at compile time.
* The new server preference "cache_folder" allows you to define the location
  of the cache ($plugins_folder/.desc in previous versions). The default value
  for this preference is /var/cache/openvas for new OpenVAS installations.
  Existing installations need to add cache_folder = /var/cache/openvas
  manually to openvasd.conf and make sure the directory exists.
* The new server preference "include_folders" allows you to specify
  search paths for the NASL include directive. This aids the use of
  subdirectories for plugins. The default value for this preference is
  $plugins_folder to be compatible with the old "flat" (all in one directory)
  structure.
* Initial support for per-target SSH credentials settings has been added. Please
  note that you will need a new client (>= 2.0.2) and a new ssh_authorization.nasl file to
  use this feature.
* Having a directory structure in $plugins_folder is now supported. openvasd
  will recurse through the subdirectories in $plugins_folder.

Note: The OpenVAS NVT feed will not use the new features for subdirectories and
include paths as long as the OpenVAS 1.0.x and OpenVAS 2.0.0 releases are
supported. An exception might be OVAL support.

Bugfixes:

* The usage of the gettext support tool in support scripts like openvas-adduser
  did expect gettext.sh to be in /usr/bin, which prevented the scripts from
  working correctly on systems where this was not the case. The gettext usage
  has been made more robust. (Solves: #860)
* During startup, openvasd will now show the correct total number of plugins
  and not count signatures and other files anymore.
* The obsolete user-specific cache (.desc in
  /var/lib/openvas/users/USER/plugins/) is not created anymore.

Stjepan Gros (for subdirs feature), Joey Schulze, Jan-Oliver Wagner,
Felix Wolfsteller and Michael Wiegand.

openvas-server 2.0-beta1 (2008-09-25)

This release is a first beta version of the upcoming 2.0 release of OpenVAS.
It introduces support for the cleaned up and improved OpenVAS Transport Protocol
(OTP, replacing NTP), the new OpenVAS NVT OID scheme and support for the Open
Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL).
The protocol cleanup also removed some features that were considered unsecure,
unneeded or wrongly placed.

OpenVAS 2.0 will introduce a full set of new modules for OpenVAS Server
(openvas-libraries, openvas-libnasl and openvas-server) and a new
OpenVAS-Client. The only  module OpenVAS 1.0 and OpenVAS 2.0 will  share is
openvas-plugins. This means that the OpenVAS NVT Feed is compatible with both
generations of OpenVAS.

However, in case you plan to try out the new generation of OpenVAS, you should
install it separately from OpenVAS 1.0 installation. Instructions on how to do
this will be added to the OpenVAS homepage after all relevant modules are
released as 2.0-beta1. A separate announcement will officially start the beta
testing phase for OpenVAS 2.0.

Main changes in this release (compared to release 1.0.1):

* Updated packaging files for Debian.
* Support for plugin upload has been removed from OpenVAS-Server.
* Support for detached scans has been removed from OpenVAS-Server.
* Switch from Nessus Transport Protocol 1.2 to OpenVAS Transport Protocol (OTP) 1.0.
* New command line parsing implementation for openvasd (internal change).
* Fix for memory management issues in plugin scheduler that resulted in aborted
  scan sessions under certain circumstances.
* Updated scripts for user management; this fixes issues with new users being
  unable to login under certain circumstances.
* Initial support for OVAL definitions.
* Updated documentation.
* Switch from Nessus plugin IDs to NVT OIDs (internal change, also applies for OTP)

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Tim Brown, Javier
Fernandez-Sanguino, Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner and Michael Wiegand

openvas-server 1.0.1 (2008-07-03)

This release contains new and improved packaging files for various distributions
as well as bug fixes and cleanups. It also adds syslog support to openvas-server
and contains a first draft for the upcoming OpenVAS Transport Protocol.

Please note that this version requires openvas-libraries 1.0.2 or newer and
openvas-libnasl 1.0.1 or newer.

Please be aware that the plugin upload feature has been disabled in
openvas-server due to security concerns as described in
http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-4.html . This functionality is now deprecated
and will be removed in future versions of openvas-server. If your existing
installation depends on this feature, we recommend that you do not update to 
1.0.1.

* Added syslog support to openvasd logging facility.
* Fixed memory leaks in plugin scheduler.
* Added and improved packaging files for Debian, OpenSUSE and Fedora.
* Changed version requirements for openvas-libraries from 0.9.2 to 1.0.2 due to
  API extension for OpenVAS OIDs.

openvas-server 1.0.0 (2008-01-31)

First stable release with only minimal changes
compared to latest 0.9 version.
No problems or any sort of issues have been
reported for over two months now.
This release is done basically
to reach the mentally important version 1.0,
there is no technical need to replace openvas-server
for a running installation.

Main changes are:

* Minor cleanups in package files.
* openvasd does not do any (useless) version check
  for -libraries and -libnasl anymore.

openvas-server 0.9.2 (2007-11-07)

Legal and minor technical fixes release.

Main changes are:

* Fixed tool "openvas-config" to output correct version
  of OpenVAS server (openvasd)
* During  installation routine, now a "gnupg" directory
  is created where the other configuration files of
  OpenVAS are located. This is the place for feed certificates.
* Removed some non-free documents (README_SSL, doc/WARNING.En
  and doc/WARNING.Fr).

openvas-server 0.9.1 (2007-10-17)

Minor cleanup release.

Main changes are:

* Version checking for openvas-libaries and openvas-libnasl
  at package configure time.
* Some code cleanups.
* Internal code refactoring.

openvas-server 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-server
after the fork from Nessus 2.2.x.

Main changes are:

* Removed the client from this package.
* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation

1.3.4 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Re-written the process manager for the hosts
- Lots of bugfixes in the plugins text store manager
- New port scanner "synscan" which uses the RTT of the packets to do
  its job. 
- Fixed several small issues in nasl and nessusd (bug fixes, code cleanup)
- Added cryptographic hashing functions in NASL
- Added the function get_kb_list() which returns the content of a KB
  without forking the plugin
- Updated the manpages of nessusd and nasl

- Implement bit xor, logical & aithmetic right shift, power
- Fix operator precedence
- Added new NASL functions

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The plugin texts are not loaded in memory any more, thus reducing
  the consumption of the nessus daemon of two megs. This also speeds up
  the loading of nessusd.

- Fixed a bug in the plugins scheduler (if optimizations were enabled, 
  the scan would sometime hang)

- Added a new NASL function (int())

- Fixed strings substraction to handle null values properly

- find_services.nes runs in parallel mode, for improved speed

- new plugin (synscan) which should perform well against firewalled
  hosts (computes the RTT before the scan)

1.3.2 : 

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Added fixes so that nessus-core/nessusd/pluginscheduler.c compiles with
  the latest version of GCC

- Fixed a bug in nessus-libraries/libnessus/bpf_share.c : a timer would not
  be reset, causing plugins which call bpf_next() to sometimes crash

- Set the timer of bpf_share.c to a much lower value, thus making it work
  much better

- Improved tcp_ping()

- Fixed two bugs in the plugins scheduler :
	- If the option "enable dependencies at runtime" is set, 
	  it would enable ALL the plugins which are depended on, instead
	  of only those we use ;

	- In some cases, it may terminate too early, thus preventing a scan
	  from being complete

- DESTDIR support

1.3.1 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Rewrote the plugins scheduler (which determines the order in which
  the plugins are to be launched). The new one is much more efficient
  but as a result, it is not possible to accurately determine the
  order in which the plugins will be ran, so the 'plugin name' in
  the client is now totally bogus
  
- Fixed various issues with NASL scripts so that they work better
  with NASL2

- Fixed bugs relative to the creation of icmp and udp packets in nasl
  
- Fixed some fatal bugs in the bpf sharer

- NASL scripts do not read /dev/urandom any more, and use time() as a
  random seed instead. As a result, the loading and execution of nasl
  scripts if faster on systems where /dev/urandom can be blocking

- Fixed the tcp NIDS evasion techniques on BSD systems

- Full support for Bugtraq IDs 

- The HTML reports add links for URLs, and show the ID number of
  the plugin that issues the report.

- Speed up the calls to arg_get_value() by using a hash of the name
  being searched for.

- Changed the licence of NASL2 to the GPLv2 (with the consent of Michel Arboi)

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- Better handling of the arrays in NASL2

. changes by Erik Anderson (eanders@carmichaelsecurity.com) 

- CVE and bugtraq cross references

. changes by Jay (jay@kinetic.org)

- Fixed multiple typos in the plugins

. changes by Javier Fernandez-Sanguino (jfernandez@germinus.com)

- Nessus now ships Hydra 2.2
- Fixed various compilation scritps (see bug#63)

1.3.0 :


. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

- Use our own nessus-services file (re-generated at first start to include
  /etc/services and nmap-services)
- Added new families of plugins (ACT_KILL_HOST and ACT_END)
- Rewrote libnasl

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The 'cancel' button of several file selection dialogs is now working
- Optimized several plugins :
	- Web-related checks now use http_recv() instead of recv()
	- open_priv_sock_tcp() has a lower timeout
	- RPC related checks now use get_rpc_port(), a function equivalent
	  to libc's getrpcport() but with a much smaller timeout
	- Decreased the default value of checks_read_timeout from 15 to 5
- Fixed a bug in the plugin selection GUI which would not refresh
  the list of plugins of a given family properly (bug#3)
- Fixed memory leaks in NASL
- Fixed a bug in nessusd which would make it leak memory when receiving a SIGHUP
  (bug#10)
- Fixed a compatibility problem with Nmap 3.10ALPHA (bug#11)
- Nessus now accepts nmap's U: and T: notation for the port range (bug#5)
- Helped Michel Arboi to give the last touches to the new libnasl
  
. changes by Erik Anderson (eanders@pobox.com)

- Added CVE and BID links, added urls and removed dead links from the plugins

. changes by Michel Scheidell (scheidell@secnap.net)

- Improved several SMB-related checks

. changes by Rodolfo Baader (rbaader@activesec.biz)

- Quotes and apostrophes are properly escaped in the XML output report


1.2.6 :


. changes by Michael Slifcak (Michael.Slifcak@guardent.com)

- Added Bugtraq cross reference in the plugins
- Added support for BID in nessusd (this has yet to be done on the
  client side)

. changes by Axel Nennker (Axel.Nennker@t-systems.com)

- fixed the xml and html outputs
- fixed array issues in a couple of plugins

. changes by Michel Arboi (arboi@alussinan.org)

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Fixed a bug which may make nasl interpret backquoted strings
  (\n and \r) received from the network (problem noted by Pavel Kankovsky)
- nmap_wrapper.nes calls _exit() instead of exit() (*)
- Solved the lack of bpf's on Free/Open/NetBSD and MacOSX by
  sharing _one_ among all the Nessus processes. As a result, Nessus's
  ping is much more effective on these platforms
- bugfix in plug_set_key() which would eventually make some scripts
  take too long when writing in the KB
- Plugins of family ACT_SETTINGS are run *after* plugins of family
  ACT_SCANNERS
- replaced the implementation of md5 which was used when OpenSSL is disabled
  by the one from RSA (the old one would not work on a big-endian host)
- Fixed plugins build issues on MacOS X
- The nessus client compiles and links against GTK+-2.0. Of course, it will
  be horrible and instable, as the GTK team does not care about backward
  compatibility


(*) These two modifications solve the problems of nmap hanging under FreeBSD
  
  
1.2.5 :

  and the end of the attack is logged (and not the time each plugin takes)
- Improved no404.nasl to further reduce false positives
- Bug fix in nessusd - under some rare circumstances, report data could
  be lost (if many many plugins were enabled at the same time and were
  sending data at the same time).
- UDP packets are resent while we wait for a reply (avoids to loose packets
  en route)
- Fixed the option "auto_enable_dependencies" which would not always work

  forces it to save its result to the current test file
- Non-printables characters are not shown in the report any more

  allowing a smooth upgrade of nessusd
- updated config.guess and config.sub

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison at nessus.org) :

- fixed mem leaks in NASL

  batch mode (Cyril Leclerc (cleclerc at boreal-com.fr))

1.0.4 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (pluto at defcom-sec.com) :

- added "Sort by Port" to the report window. Saving of this is not finished.

- arglist_insert sorts first by holes, then by warnings, then by
  notes. Previous version only sorted by holes.

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) :

- ftp related checks : the user can now supply a login/password
  for the ftp checks, and relies on the ftp banner if nessusd can't
  log into the ftp server (requested by Jens.Oeser at connector.de).

- libnessus : ftp_log_in() would sometime fail against some ftp
  servers

- better handling of large reports

- tests are saved on the server side and can be restored. Note that

- fixed a possible deadlock in the nessusd internal communication

- fixed a problem in the client that would make it crash if it received
  a malformed message from the server

- the client would not detect the death of the server when run in batch mode

- possible header confusion (with regex.h) fixed

- typo in showmount.nasl would prevent it to work over udp (ctor at krixor.xy.org)


1.0.3 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) :

- fixed various small problems in various plugins
- fixed a nasty bug in libnasl that would prevent raw packets from being
  read
- compiles under Solaris
- possible segfault in the client fixed


1.0.2 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (christoph.puppe at defcom-sec.com) :

- Unified the naming of Vulnerability, Warning, Note in ASCII and HTML.

- latex_report_category seems like an oversimplification to me. What
  if we have a large network with lots of small holes, is this saver
  than a network with only one big? I've made a try on weighted
  rules. Hosts with holes get elevated to *10, warnings to *5 and
  notes stay where they are.

- added Level Note, it has it's own dot and is meant to be used for
  notes and notifications. The tex file is updated.

- changed smalies in various functions, to be easier to read, faster
  or more generic.

- plugins: finger.nasl was buggy

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) : 
 
- possible hang at report time fixed in the client

  with a 404 error code when request an inexistant page

- fixed various compilations errors occuring on various
  platforms

- libnasl : fixed a bug that would occur in standalone mode

- nessus-libraries : takes the presence of the shared libraries
  of the system into account
  
- SMB and DCE/RPC over SMB issues :

   . smb_login.nasl : fixed an error (would always want
     to access IPC$ to declare that a login is valid)  

   . netbios_name_get.nasl : fixed an error which would
     prevent the SMB tests to work against Windows 2000

   . smb_dom2sid.nasl : LsarQueryInfoPolicy() now obtains the
     host sid, rather than the sid of the domain, so that local accounts
     are shown and tested (instead of the domain accounts only)

   . smb_enum_services.nasl : Lists the services that are running
     on the remote host

- new security checks added


. changes by Jordan Hrycaj (jordan at nessus.org) : 

- libpeks now uses the libgmp that comes with the operating system 
  if any, and does the same for libz
  
- fixed a bug that would prevent the client from working properly
  under OpenBSD
  
1.0.1 :

- nessus : fixed errors when generating pies and charts which would
  cause horrible graphics (thanks to John Q. Public (tpublic at dimensional.com)
  for pointing this out)

  forge_tcp_packet() fixed

- nessus-update-plugins : somehow improved

- plugins : more SMB checks, rewritten showmount in nasl, tons of new security
  checks (for a total of 435, whatever that means)

- plugins : fixed snmp_default_communities which was bugged. Thanks to
  W. Mark Herrick, Jr. (markh at va.rr.com) for pointing this out.

- gmp 3.0 is used by libpeks (vs 2.0.2)  

1.0.0 :

- nessus : fixed problems with the "spiffy" HTML export

- plugins : nearly 20 new security checks (including SMB checks)

- hinting to NESSUSHOME if ~/.nessusrc is not available (jh)

1.0.0pre3 :

- added the utility nessus-update-plugins(8). See the man
  page for security notes

- nessus : HTML reports now include links to the CVE entries

- nessus-adduser / libpeks : it is now possible to declare 
  from which host a user can connect to nessusd 
  
- plugins : better behavior of the CGI tests against hosts
  which do not issue 404 error codes

- security : nessusd.users would sometime be in mode 0644 (due
  to nessus-adduser), accounts.nes would let nessusd users read
  arbitrary files on the system

  a host it's not allowed to (suggested by Hermann Himmelbauer 
  <dusty@violin-kan.dyndns.org>)

  compiled with a special ./configure flag (thanks to 
  Bradley M Alexander <storm@tux.org>)

- nessus : changed the .nsr file format to something more easily parseable
  which contains the ID of the plugins which generate security warnings
  or holes

- nessus : error dialog makes more sense when nessusd is killed in the middle
  of a test (pointed out by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>)

- nessus : fixed a segmentation fault that could occur during the login
  (Stefan Rapp s.rapp@hrz.uni-dortmund.de)

  when doing few tests against a great number of hosts)    

- nessusd.conf goes back to ${sysconfdir}/nessus/ (and not
  ${sysconfdir}/)

- nessusd CPU usage : dropped from 100% to much fewer [thanks to
  Ryan Mooney <ryanm@mhpcc.edu> who pointed this out]

0.99.8 :

- OpenBSD portability

- HP/UX shl_* support

- re-attributed the plugins category, thanks to the lists made by
  Jeff Odegard <jeff@digitaldefense.net> who divided the plugins
  into three categories : begnign, intrusive and potentially destructive

- the client disable all the potentially destructive plugins if they
  are not in ~/.nessusrc, and puts a warning sign in front of them

- plugins have been attributed a unique ID

- plugins are CVE compatible

- NASL now supports regular expressions through the ereg() function. The
  syntax of the regexps is egrep-style, that I personnaly like.

  big networks

- fixed a problem in nessusd which would make it slow down then crawl when
  it was testing big networks

0.99.6 :

- many segmentation faults corrected

- fixed a problem in the client <-> server communication which would make
  the server "forget" to send some data to the client

0.99.5 :

- New HTML export with pies and graphs

- Handles the HTTP redirects (thanks to  
  Andreas J. Koenig <andreas.koenig@anima.de> for requesting it)

- behaves well when the same service is detected more than once on the target
  side. Ie: if the target is running 2 web servers, then all the security checks
  will be performed on both

- Nicer client GUI

- Communication between the client and the server's children done in a
  cleaner way
- Corrected a bug in the client that would prevent it to work
  when not compiled with the cipher layer
  
- Added a inetd friendly option

- The quiet mode of the client will produce HTML, LaTeX, text or 
  .nsr files regarding the file suffix given as argument
  
- ASCII text output

- report can be saved to stdout

- kept-alive connection between the client and the server (no need to
  log in again between two tests)  

0.99.4 :

- Speedup

- Several segmentation faults fixed

- The user can now select the timeout value of the security checks read()
  function

- The client can specify an alternate configuration file

- Client : fixed problems regarding when to use the GUI

Previous versions :

- Corrected a problem regarding the list of checks selected by the user

- ${prefix}/var/nessus is created

- Corrected a typo in the code that would generate the preferences
  file

- Changed the behaviour of the nessus client, when it is started in the
  background and a pass phrase is wanted as input.  If available,
  the client terminates while complaining to the stderr.

- Added long options to the nessus client; as a side effect, the command
  line version works under windows, too

- OpenBSD portability issues

- Fixed the process tracker on cipher layer to meet the io thread
  table overflow

- Updated the process mgmnt, provided a general pty interface for
  subprocesses like nmap

- Reduced memory consumption by 50%

- Nessus can now use nmap(1). Thanks to Phil Brutsche <pbrutsch@creighton.edu>
  who helped me to figure out how to do this.

- Configuration files now installed in ${prefix}/etc/nessus/

- Man pages for nasl-config, nessus-config, nessus-build, as well
  as patches to problems that may occur during the installation
  by Josip Rodin <joy@cibalia.gkvk.hr>
  
- More efficient way to determine whether a DoS was successful or not.  
  Thanks to Michel Arboi <arboi@alussinan.org> for the suggestion
  (does not work well yet)

- The communication errors : 'out of threads already' and 'no cookie
  for received packets' have been fixed.

- All the newest security tests

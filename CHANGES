openvas-server 1.0.1 (2008-07-03)

This release contains new and improved packaging files for various distributions
as well as bug fixes and cleanups. It also adds syslog support to openvas-server
and contains a first draft for the upcoming OpenVAS Transport Protocol.

Please note that this version requires openvas-libraries 1.0.2 or newer and
openvas-libnasl 1.0.1 or newer.

Please be aware that the plugin upload feature has been disabled in
openvas-server due to security concerns as described in
http://www.openvas.org/openvas-cr-4.html . This functionality is now deprecated
and will be removed in future versions of openvas-server. If your existing
installation depends on this feature, we recommend that you do not update to 
1.0.1.

* Added syslog support to openvasd logging facility.
* Fixed memory leaks in plugin scheduler.
* Added and improved packaging files for Debian, OpenSUSE and Fedora.
* Changed version requirements for openvas-libraries from 0.9.2 to 1.0.2 due to
  API extension for OpenVAS OIDs.
* Changed version requirements for openvas-libnasl from 0.9.1 to 1.0.1 due to
  API extension for OpenVAS OIDs.
* Disabled plugin upload feature due to security concerns.
* Fixed possible buffer overflow in user authentication.
* Fixed a configuration issue that broke the build process on certain 64bit
  installations.
* Added a first draft of the specification for the upcoming OpenVAS Transport
  Protocol.
* Various code cleanups.

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release: Bernhard Herzog,
Jan Wagner, Jan-Oliver Wagner, Michael Wiegand and others.

openvas-server 1.0.0 (2008-01-31)

First stable release with only minimal changes
compared to latest 0.9 version.
No problems or any sort of issues have been
reported for over two months now.
This release is done basically
to reach the mentally important version 1.0,
there is no technical need to replace openvas-server
for a running installation.

Main changes are:

* Minor cleanups in package files.
* openvasd does not do any (useless) version check
  for -libraries and -libnasl anymore.

openvas-server 0.9.2 (2007-11-07)

Legal and minor technical fixes release.

Main changes are:

* Fixed tool "openvas-config" to output correct version
  of OpenVAS server (openvasd)
* During  installation routine, now a "gnupg" directory
  is created where the other configuration files of
  OpenVAS are located. This is the place for feed certificates.
* Removed some non-free documents (README_SSL, doc/WARNING.En
  and doc/WARNING.Fr).

openvas-server 0.9.1 (2007-10-17)

Minor cleanup release.

Main changes are:

* Version checking for openvas-libaries and openvas-libnasl
  at package configure time.
* Some code cleanups.
* Internal code refactoring.

openvas-server 0.9.0 (2007-07-27)

The first initial release of openvas-server
after the fork from Nessus 2.2.x.

Main changes are:

* Removed the client from this package.
* Replace OpenSSL by GNU/TLS (therefore it is allowed now to distribute
  binary packages with SSL-support)
* SSL now mandatory.
* Many cleanups of ancient remains (still many to come)
* Removed various W32-specific elements, because W32 isn't
  a taget system anyway.
* Lots of renaming to avoid conflicts with parallel
  Nessus installation

- Ported to IRIX
- Several small bugfixes

. changes by Xueyong Zhi <zhi@mail.eecis.udel.edu>

1.3.4 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Re-written the process manager for the hosts
- Lots of bugfixes in the plugins text store manager
- New port scanner "synscan" which uses the RTT of the packets to do
  its job.

- Added cryptographic hashing functions in NASL
- Added the function get_kb_list() which returns the content of a KB

- Implement bit xor, logical & aithmetic right shift, power
- Fix operator precedence
- Added new NASL functions

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The plugin texts are not loaded in memory any more, thus reducing
  the consumption of the nessus daemon of two megs. This also speeds up
  the loading of nessusd.

- Fixed a bug in the plugins scheduler (if optimizations were enabled, 
  the scan would sometime hang)

- Added a new NASL function (int())

- Fixed strings substraction to handle null values properly

- find_services.nes runs in parallel mode, for improved speed

1.3.2 : 

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Added fixes so that nessus-core/nessusd/pluginscheduler.c compiles with
  the latest version of GCC

- Fixed a bug in nessus-libraries/libnessus/bpf_share.c : a timer would not
  be reset, causing plugins which call bpf_next() to sometimes crash

- Set the timer of bpf_share.c to a much lower value, thus making it work
  much better

- Improved tcp_ping()

- Fixed two bugs in the plugins scheduler :
	- If the option "enable dependencies at runtime" is set, 
	  it would enable ALL the plugins which are depended on, instead
	  of only those we use ;

	- In some cases, it may terminate too early, thus preventing a scan
	  from being complete

- DESTDIR support

1.3.1 :

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Rewrote the plugins scheduler (which determines the order in which
  the plugins are to be launched). The new one is much more efficient
  but as a result, it is not possible to accurately determine the
  order in which the plugins will be ran, so the 'plugin name' in
  the client is now totally bogus
  
- Fixed various issues with NASL scripts so that they work better
  with NASL2

- Fixed bugs relative to the creation of icmp and udp packets in nasl
  
- Fixed some fatal bugs in the bpf sharer

- NASL scripts do not read /dev/urandom any more, and use time() as a
  random seed instead. As a result, the loading and execution of nasl
  scripts if faster on systems where /dev/urandom can be blocking

- Fixed the tcp NIDS evasion techniques on BSD systems

- Full support for Bugtraq IDs 

- The HTML reports add links for URLs, and show the ID number of
  the plugin that issues the report.

  being searched for.

- Changed the licence of NASL2 to the GPLv2 (with the consent of Michel Arboi)

  /etc/services and nmap-services)
- Added new families of plugins (ACT_KILL_HOST and ACT_END)
- Rewrote libnasl

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- The 'cancel' button of several file selection dialogs is now working
- Optimized several plugins :
	- Web-related checks now use http_recv() instead of recv()
	- open_priv_sock_tcp() has a lower timeout
	- RPC related checks now use get_rpc_port(), a function equivalent
	  to libc's getrpcport() but with a much smaller timeout
	- Decreased the default value of checks_read_timeout from 15 to 5
- Fixed a bug in the plugin selection GUI which would not refresh
  the list of plugins of a given family properly (bug#3)

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Fixed a bug which may make nasl interpret backquoted strings
  (\n and \r) received from the network (problem noted by Pavel Kankovsky)
- nmap_wrapper.nes calls _exit() instead of exit() (*)
- Solved the lack of bpf's on Free/Open/NetBSD and MacOSX by
  sharing _one_ among all the Nessus processes. As a result, Nessus's
  ping is much more effective on these platforms
- bugfix in plug_set_key() which would eventually make some scripts
  take too long when writing in the KB
- Plugins of family ACT_SETTINGS are run *after* plugins of family
  ACT_SCANNERS
- replaced the implementation of md5 which was used when OpenSSL is disabled
  by the one from RSA (the old one would not work on a big-endian host)
- Fixed plugins build issues on MacOS X
- The nessus client compiles and links against GTK+-2.0. Of course, it will
  be horrible and instable, as the GTK team does not care about backward
  compatibility


(*) These two modifications solve the problems of nmap hanging under FreeBSD

. changes by Renaud Deraison (deraison@cvs.nessus.org)

- Reverted back to autoconf 2.13. 
- Bug fix in nessus-core/nessusd/pluginlaunch.c - under some circumstances,
  data might have be lost in the reports

  and the end of the attack is logged (and not the time each plugin takes)
- Improved no404.nasl to further reduce false positives
- Bug fix in nessusd - under some rare circumstances, report data could
  be lost (if many many plugins were enabled at the same time and were
  sending data at the same time).
- UDP packets are resent while we wait for a reply (avoids to loose packets
  en route)
- Fixed the option "auto_enable_dependencies" which would not always work
- Sending a SIGTERM to the nessus client during a command line scan
  forces it to save its result to the current test file
- Non-printables characters are not shown in the report any more

  in a while (saves CPU)
- Bugfix in the client : some host names would make the client crash 
- Repaired the '-P' switch in the client

  in nessus-libraries)
- KB items are now stored with individual dates instead of a global

- a GTK error would sometime be produced when the client is run in
  batch mode (Cyril Leclerc (cleclerc at boreal-com.fr))

1.0.4 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (pluto at defcom-sec.com) :

- added "Sort by Port" to the report window. Saving of this is not finished.

- arglist_insert sorts first by holes, then by warnings, then by
  notes. Previous version only sorted by holes.

. changes by Renaud Deraison (renaud at nessus.org) :

- ftp related checks : the user can now supply a login/password
  for the ftp checks, and relies on the ftp banner if nessusd can't
  log into the ftp server (requested by Jens.Oeser at connector.de).

- libnessus : ftp_log_in() would sometime fail against some ftp
  servers

- better handling of large reports

- tests are saved on the server side and can be restored. Note that

  smb_accessible_shares.nasl

- added checks for unpassworded MySQLs and PostgreSQL databases

- nessusd uses less memory

. changes by Pavel Kankovsky (peak at argo.troja.mff.cuni.cz) :

- fixed a possible deadlock in the nessusd internal communication

- fixed a problem in the client that would make it crash if it received
  a malformed message from the server

- fixed various small problems in various plugins
- fixed a nasty bug in libnasl that would prevent raw packets from being
  read
- compiles under Solaris
- possible segfault in the client fixed


1.0.2 :

. changes by Christoph Puppe (christoph.puppe at defcom-sec.com) :

- Unified the naming of Vulnerability, Warning, Note in ASCII and HTML.

- latex_report_category seems like an oversimplification to me. What
  if we have a large network with lots of small holes, is this saver
  than a network with only one big? I've made a try on weighted
  rules. Hosts with holes get elevated to *10, warnings to *5 and
  notes stay where they are.

- added Level Note, it has it's own dot and is meant to be used for
  notes and notifications. The tex file is updated.

- changed smalies in various functions, to be easier to read, faster
  or more generic.

- plugins: finger.nasl was buggy

  with a 404 error code when request an inexistant page

- fixed various compilations errors occuring on various
  platforms

- libnasl : fixed a bug that would occur in standalone mode

- nessus-libraries : takes the presence of the shared libraries
  of the system into account
  
- SMB and DCE/RPC over SMB issues :

   . smb_login.nasl : fixed an error (would always want
     to access IPC$ to declare that a login is valid)  

   . netbios_name_get.nasl : fixed an error which would
     prevent the SMB tests to work against Windows 2000

   . smb_dom2sid.nasl : LsarQueryInfoPolicy() now obtains the
     host sid, rather than the sid of the domain, so that local accounts
     are shown and tested (instead of the domain accounts only)

   . smb_enum_services.nasl : Lists the services that are running
     on the remote host

- new security checks added


. changes by Jordan Hrycaj (jordan at nessus.org) : 

- libpeks now uses the libgmp that comes with the operating system 
  if any, and does the same for libz

1.0.0pre3 :

- added the utility nessus-update-plugins(8). See the man
  page for security notes

- nessus : HTML reports now include links to the CVE entries

  from which host a user can connect to nessusd 
  
- plugins : better behavior of the CGI tests against hosts
  which do not issue 404 error codes

  to nessus-adduser), accounts.nes would let nessusd users read
  arbitrary files on the system

  a host it's not allowed to (suggested by Hermann Himmelbauer 
  <dusty@violin-kan.dyndns.org>)

  port

  
1.0.0pre2 :

- nessusd : the rules now accept the keyword 'client_ip'  (suggested
  by  Hermann Himmelbauer <dusty@violin-kan.dyndns.org>)  

- nessusd : logs the name of the plugins that are loaded (suggested 
  by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>)  
- nessus : the 'reverse lookup' option now works

- nessus : typo would prevent to compile nessus with gtk 1.0 (thanks to
  mike <michael.seeger@mchh.siemens.de> for pointing this out)

- nessus : changed the .nsr file format to something more easily parseable
  which contains the ID of the plugins which generate security warnings
  or holes

- nessus : error dialog makes more sense when nessusd is killed in the middle
  of a test (pointed out by Matthias Andree <ma@dt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de>)

  for pointing this out again.

- nessus : other cosmetics things have been fixed

- nasl : now supports user-defined functions (see the documentation
  for more details)  

- plugins : ssh_insertion.nasl : fixed a typo which would cause the plugin
  to yell when the user was using OpenSSH 1.2.2 (which is immune to this
  problem). Thanks to R. Pickett <emerson@hayseed.net> for pointing this out

- plugins : lot of new security checks (thanks to  Roelof Temmingh
    <roelof@sensepost.com> for pointing out some missing IIS checks)

  the user close the test window during a test

- nessus : saves the preferences of each plugin

- nessusd : fixed a problem in the rules which ended up being
  too restrictive

- nessusd : killall -1 nessusd now works  

- plugins : nmap_wrapper.nes : compatible with the new output of nmap

- traditional netmasks (255.255.255.0) are now accepted

- nessusd.conf goes back to ${sysconfdir}/nessus/ (and not
  ${sysconfdir}/)

- nessusd CPU usage : dropped from 100% to much fewer [thanks to
  Ryan Mooney <ryanm@mhpcc.edu> who pointed this out]

- nessus and nessusd : the target file may have an unlimited size
  (it was cut down to 2047 bytes in the past) [many thanks to 
  Boris Wesslowski <Boris.Wesslowski@RUS.Uni-Stuttgart.DE> for pointing
  this out]

- Client : fixed problems regarding when to use the GUI

Previous versions :

- Corrected a problem regarding the list of checks selected by the user

- ${prefix}/var/nessus is created

- Corrected a typo in the code that would generate the preferences
  file

- Changed the behaviour of the nessus client, when it is started in the
  background and a pass phrase is wanted as input.  If available,
  the client terminates while complaining to the stderr.

- Added long options to the nessus client; as a side effect, the command
  line version works under windows, too

- OpenBSD portability issues

- Fixed the process tracker on cipher layer to meet the io thread
  table overflow

- Updated the process mgmnt, provided a general pty interface for
  subprocesses like nmap

- Reduced memory consumption by 50%

- Nessus can now use nmap(1). Thanks to Phil Brutsche <pbrutsch@creighton.edu>
  who helped me to figure out how to do this.

- Configuration files now installed in ${prefix}/etc/nessus/

- Man pages for nasl-config, nessus-config, nessus-build, as well
  as patches to problems that may occur during the installation

- More efficient way to determine whether a DoS was successful or not.  
  Thanks to Michel Arboi <arboi@alussinan.org> for the suggestion
  (does not work well yet)

- The communication errors : 'out of threads already' and 'no cookie
  for received packets' have been fixed.

- All the newest security tests

# smoke-test

Contains a small subset of functionality tests for openvasd within a controlled environment.

To build and run the tests a Makefile is provided:
- make build - builds the smoketest binary
- make run - runs a scan against an scanner API listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000.

## Configuration
Usage of api-key is optional. For details on how to configure it, see the [openvasd documentation](../../src/openvasd/README.md).

In case of running the test against a mTLS enabled `openvasd`, you need to configure the client key and cert as well in the smoke test environment. For details on how to configure it, see the [openvasd documentation](../../src/openvasd/README.md).

For creation of the key/cert pair for mTLS authentication, see the tls section in the [openvasd documentation](../../src/openvasd/README.md). Also, you find certificate generators in the [examples](../../examples/tls/)

For authenticated scans, you can set a custom target (default is 127.0.0.1), username and password.

All settings for running the smoke-tests are set via environmental variables. The next table summarize the settings availables:

|Variable|Description|Default|Mandatory|Comment|
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
|TARGET_HOSTNAME|Custom target|127.0.0.1|no|Necessary for authenticated scans|
|TARGET_USERNAME|Username for login in the target during the authenticated scan|empty string|no|Necessary for authenticated scans|
|TARGET_PASSWORD|Password for login in the target during the authenticated scan|empty string|no|Necessary for authenticated scans|
|API_KEY|API Key for authenticated communication with `openvasd`|None|no||
|OPENVASD_SERVER|Socket where openvasd listen on|http://127.0.0.1:3000|no|Must be specified with port|
|CLIENT_CERT|PEM file combinating public certificate and any 3rd party intermediate certificates ||yes for mTLS|Necessary for mTLS enabled|
|CLIENT_KEY|Client private key||yes for mTLS|Necessary for mTLS enabled|
|SCAN_CONFIG|Scan config in json file format to be run against the target|simple_scan_ssh_only.json|yes||

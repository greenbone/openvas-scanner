# scannerctl

Is CLI frontend to use rust scanner utilities.

Usage: `scannerctl [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>`

Options:

- `-v`, `--verbose`: Prints more details while running
- `-h`, `--help`:    Print help
- `-V`, `--version`: Print version

## Build

Run `cargo test` to test and `cargo build --release` to build it.

## Install

`cargo install --path .`

## Commands

### execute

Executes either a script or a scan.a

Usage: `scannerctl execute [COMMAND]`

#### script

Executes a nasl script using a in memory data base.

It executes either a script via a path or an OID. When an OID is provided it requires the `-p` option to be valid feed to find the script belonging to that OID, otherwise the `-p` is optional and when set does not need to have a sha256sums.

The optional `--target, -t` option allows to set a host target to run the script against to:

When `-v` is set it is printing the statements to be executed as well as the returned NaslValue.

As examples executing: `scannerctl execute examples/hello.nasl` returns:
```text
Hello, world!
```
while executing `scannerctl -v execute examples/hello.nasl` returns:

```text
> if (description == 1) {{ ... }}
=> Null
> display(Hello, world!)
Hello, world!
=> Null
```

Usage: `scannerctl execute script [OPTIONS] [-t HOST] <script>`

#### scan

Executes a given scan using a in memory data base.

A scan can either be provided by stdin in combination with the `--input` flag or via json file.

Usage: `scannerctl execute scan [OPTIONS] --path <FILE> [json]`

Arguments: [json]: The scan json as described in [scanner-api](https://greenbone.github.io/scanner-api/#/scan)

Options:
-  `-p`, `--path <FILE>`: Path to the feed.
-  `--schedule`: Prints just the schedule without executing the scan
-  `-i`, `--input`: Parses scan json from stdin.
-  `-h`, `--help`: Print help

Usage: `scannerctl execute scan [OPTIONS] --path <FILE> [json]`

### syntax

```text
Verifies syntax of NASL files in given dir or file.

Usage: scannerctl syntax [OPTIONS] <path>

Arguments:
  <path>

Options:
  -q, --quiet  Prints only error output and no progress.
  -h, --help   Print help
```

### scan-config

Transforms a scan-config from gvmds data-objects to scan json of [openvasd](https://greenbone.github.io/scanner-api/#/scan/create_scanl).

To set the target and credentials you can pipe a partial scan json into `scannerctl scan-config` by providing `-i` flag.

As an example we assume that the data-objects feed is in `~/src/greenbone/data-objects/content/22.04` while the vulnerability feed is in `~/src/greenbone/vulnerability-tests/nasl/common` and we want to create a scan to verify localhost with a discovery and full and fast policy on the openvas default portlist.

For that we need to execute:

```text
echo '{ "target": { "hosts": ["localhost"], "ports": [] }, "vts": [] }'| \
scannerctl scan-config -i -p ~/src/greenbone/vulnerability-tests/nasl/common \
  -l ~/src/greenbone/data-objects/content/22.04/port-lists/openvas-default-c7e03b6c-3bbe-11e1-a057-406186ea4fc5.xml \
  ~/src/greenbone/data-objects/content/22.04/scan-configs/discovery-8715c877-47a0-438d-98a3-27c7a6ab2196.xml \
  ~/src/greenbone/data-objects/content/22.04/scan-configs/full-and-fast-daba56c8-73ec-11df-a475-002264764cea.xml
```

Be aware that each call does a description run of the defined feed to gather the meta data, depending on your system and the size of the feed it requires may some time.

#### Usage

```text
Transforms a scan-config xml to a scan json for openvasd.
When piping a scan json it is enriched with the scan-config xml and may the portlist otherwise it will print a scan json without target or credentials.

Usage: scannerctl scan-config [OPTIONS] <scan-config>

Arguments:
  <scan-config>

Options:
  -p, --path <FILE>      Path to the feed.
  -i, --input            Parses scan json from stdin.
  -l, --portlist <FILE>  Path to the port list xml
  -h, --help             Print help
```

### notus

Does use notus products to compare packages against known vulnerabilities. It can be used to do a single notus scan by providing a list of packages and an operating system. A notus scan will then lookup the provided packages and compares it version to known vulnerabilities. The results will be printed on the command line.

#### Usage

```text
does use notus products to compare packages against known vulnerabilities.

Usage: scannerctl notus [OPTIONS] --path <FILE> <os>...

Arguments:
  <os>...

Options:
  -p, --path <FILE>   Path to the product feed.
  -i, --input         comma separated pkg list from stdin.
  -l, --pkg <STRING>  Comma separated list of packages.
  -v, --verbose...    Prints more details while running
  -h, --help          Print help
```

### feed

Handles feed related tasks.

Usage: `scannerctl feed <COMMAND>`

#### update

Runs nasl scripts in description mode and updates data into redis so that ospd-openvas can read the data.
Also, load the Notus advisories up into the redis cache. The path to the notus advisories must be provided.

When either path or redis is not set it will get the defaults by calling `openvas -s`.

Usage `scannerctl feed update [OPTIONS]`

Usage example, load both:
`GPGHOME=/path/to/.gnupg scannerctl feed update --notus-path <path-to-the-advisories> --signature-check`

Options:
- `-v`, `--vts-only`: Load only nvts into redis cache
- `-n`, `--notus-only`: Load only Notus advisories into redis cache
- `--vts-path <FILE>`: Path to the feed.
- `--notus-path <FILE>`: Path to the notus advisories.
- `-x`, `--signature-check`: Enable NASL signature check.
- `-r`, `--redis <VALUE>`: Redis url. Must either start `unix://` or `redis://`.

On `feed update` it will first read the `sha256sums` file within the feed directory and verify each file with the corresponding sha256sums. When the hash is correct it will execute each mentioned `*.nasl` script within that dir with `description = 1`.
Optionally, it is possible to perform a signature verification of the sha256sums file before uploading. To perform the signature check, also the environment variable `GNUPGHOME` must be set with the gnupg home directory, where the `pubring.kbx` file is stored.

Notus advisories and VTs can be uploaded independtently using the options `--vts-only` and `--notus-only` respectively. They can not be used together. 

#### transform

Runs nasl scripts in description mode and returns it as a json array into stdout.

When path is not set it will get the defaults by calling `openvas -s`.

Usage `scannerctl feed transform [OPTIONS]`

Options:
- `-p`, `--path <FILE>`:   Path to the feed.

On `feed transform` it will first read the `sha256sums` file within the feed directory and verify each file with the corresponding sha256sums. When the hash is correct it will execute each mentioned `*.nasl` script within that dir with `description = 1`.
Optionally, it is possible to perform a signature verification of the sha256sums file before the transformation. To enable the signature check, the environment variable `GNUPGHOME` must be set with the gnupg home directory, where the `pubring.kbx` file is stored.

It will produce a json array in stdout in the format described within [json-storage](../storage/json/README.md)

#### transpile

Tool for feed manipulation. Transforms each nasl script and inc file based on the given rules.
Currently it is able to rename, remove, add, push parameter or functions within a feed.

Usage `scannerctl feed transpile [OPTIONS] --rules <FILE>`

Options:
- `-p`, `--path <FILE>`: Path to the feed.
- `-r`, `--rules <FILE>`: Path to transpiler rules.
- `-h`, `--help`: Print help

An example can be found in [examples](../../examples/scannerctl/transpile.toml) folder. This example demonstrates how to
- rename service `www` to `word-wide-web` in register_product
- `register_host_detail` to `add_host_detail`

to execute it call:

`scannerctl -v feed transpile -p /tmp/feed -r examples/scannerctl/transpile.toml`

##### NVT

Describes meta information for a nasl script. Each nasl script must have a description block that may looks something like:

```text
if (description)
{
  script_oid("0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1");
  script_version("2023-02-23T13:33:44+0000");
  script_tag(name:"last_modification", value:"2020-12-07 13:33:44 +0000 (Mon, 07 Dec 2020)");
  script_tag(name:"creation_date", value:"2009-05-12 22:04:51 +0200 (Tue, 12 May 2009)");
  script_tag(name:"cvss_base_vector", value:"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:N");
  script_name("Application Server Detection (HTTP)");
  script_category(ACT_GATHER_INFO);
  script_tag(name:"qod_type", value:"remote_banner");
  script_family("Product detection");
  script_copyright("Copyright (C) 2023 Greenbone AG");
  script_dependencies("find_service.nasl", "httpver.nasl", "global_settings.nasl");
  script_require_ports("Services/www", 6262);
  script_exclude_keys("Settings/disable_cgi_scanning");
  script_tag(name:"summary", value:"HTTP AS detection");
  script_xref(name:"URL", value:"https://greenbone.net");
  exit(0);
}
...
exit(42);
```

Based on the requirement that each description block must have an `exit(0);` call in it the script can be safely run with `description = 1`. to update / create so called meta-data.
